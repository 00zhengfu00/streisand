Streisand
=========

**Silence censorhip. Automate the [effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).**

Streisand is an advanced anti-censorship toolkit built on the [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) open source automation platform that does the following:

* Makes it possible for individuals and organizations to quickly provision new servers running the latest version of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and a wide variety of VPN and encrypted networking software
* Helps users configure their computers and mobile devices to securely route their Internet traffic through these servers and evade blocking attempts
* Removes the pain involved for both groups

Features
--------
* Rapid creation and configuration of new servers. Several providers are supported directly:
  * [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
  * [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
  * [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)
  * [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/)

  Streisand can also run on any new fleet of Debian 7 servers regardless of provider, and **hundreds** of instances can be configured simultaneously using this method.
* Distinct services and multiple daemons provide an enormous amount of flexibility. If one connection method gets blocked there are several other options available, most of which are resistant to Deep Packet Inspection.

  * All of the connection methods (including L2TP/IPsec and direct OpenVPN connections) are effective against the type of blocking Turkey has been experimenting with
  * OpenSSH, OpenVPN (wrapped in stunnel), Shadowsocks, and Tor (with obfsproxy and the obfs3 or ScrambleSuit pluggable transports) are all currently effective against China's Great Firewall

* Server setup is completely automated. There are no manual steps whatsoever. Every task has also been thoroughly documented and given a detailed description. Streisand is simultaneously the most complete HOWTO in existence for the setup of all of the software it installs, and also the antidote for ever having to do any of this by hand again.
* Custom, step-by-step client configuration instructions are generated for each new server that Streisand creates. The instructions include all relevant details (e.g. unique passwords, IP address information, etc.) as well as all necessary ancillary files. This content is placed into a neatly organized directory structure that is perfect for copying to a flash drive or sending to someone as an encrypted archive so they can get back online as soon as possible.
* All software runs on ports that have been deliberately chosen to make simplistic port blocking unrealistic without causing massive collateral damage. OpenVPN, for example, does not run on its default port of 1194, but instead uses port 636, the standard port for LDAP/SSL connections that are beloved by companies worldwide.
  * *L2TP/IPsec is a notable exception to this rule because the ports cannot be changed without breaking client compatibility*
* IP addresses of connecting clients are never logged

Services Provided
-----------------
* L2TP/IPsec using [strongSwan](http://strongswan.org/) and [xl2tpd](http://www.xelerance.com/software/xl2tpd/)
  * A randomly chosen pre-shared key and password are generated
  * Windows, OS X, Android, and iOS users can all connect using the native VPN support that is built into each operating system without installing any additional software  
  * *Note: Streisand does not install L2TP/IPsec on Amazon EC2 servers by default because the instances cannot bind directly to their public IP addresses which makes IPsec routing nearly impossible.*
* [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/)
  * An unprivileged forwarding user and SSH keypair are generated for [sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) and SOCKS capabilities. Windows and Android SSH tunnels are also supported.
  * [Tinyproxy](https://banu.com/tinyproxy/) is installed and bound to localhost. It can be accessed over an SSH tunnel by programs that do not natively support SOCKS and that require an HTTP proxy, such as Twitter for Android.
* [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html)
  * Self-contained "unified" .ovpn profiles are generated for easy client configuration using only a single file
  * Multiple clients can share the same certificates and keys; five separate sets are generated by default
  * Client DNS resolution is handled via [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) to prevent DNS leaks
  * TLS Authentication is enabled which helps protect against active probing attacks. Traffic that does not have the proper HMAC is simply dropped.
  * The [Dante](http://www.inet.no/dante/) proxy server is set up as a workaround for a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=947801) in Firefox for Android
* [Shadowsocks](http://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html)
  * A QR code is generated that allows the Android and iOS clients to be automatically configured by simply taking a picture. You can tag '8.8.8.8' on that concrete wall, or you can glue the Shadowsocks instructions and some QR codes to it instead!
* [Stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/index.html)
  * Listens for and wraps OpenVPN connections. This makes them look like standard SSL traffic and allows OpenVPN clients to successfully establish tunnels even in the presence of Deep Packet Inspection.
  * Profiles for stunnel-wrapped OpenVPN connections are generated alongside the direct connection profiles. Detailed instructions are also generated.
  * The stunnel certificate and key are exported in PKCS #12 format so they are compatible with other SSL tunneling applications. Notably, this allows [OpenVPN for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn) to tunnel its traffic through [SSLDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.blint.ssldroid). OpenVPN in China on a mobile device? Yes!
* [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
  * A [bridge relay](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) running on port 443 is set up with a random nickname
  * [Obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en) is installed and configured, including support for the obfs3 and [ScrambleSuit](http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/) pluggable transports

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites ###
* The Streisand playbook should be run on a BSD, Linux, or OS X system
* You must have an SSH key present in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
* The [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/) package management system for Python should be installed
  * On Debian and Ubuntu

      `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
  * On Fedora

      `sudo yum install python-pip`
  * On OS X

      `sudo easy_install pip`
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) should also be ready to go
  * On OS X Mavericks

      `sudo CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments pip install ansible`
  * On BSD, Linux, or earlier versions of OS X

      `sudo pip install ansible`
* Any necessary Python libraries for your chosen cloud provider must be present if you are going to take advantage of Streisand's ability to create new servers using a supported API
  * Amazon EC2

      `sudo pip install boto`
  * DigitalOcean

      `sudo pip install dopy`
  * Linode

      `sudo pip install linode-python`
  * Rackspace Cloud

      `sudo pip install pyrax`

### Execution ###
1. Clone this repository and enter the directory

      `git clone https://github.com/jlund/streisand.git && cd streisand`
2. Execute the playbook for your chosen cloud provider. For example, the following command will create and configure a new DigitalOcean server:

      `ansible-playbook new-digitalocean-server.yml`
3. Follow the customized prompts to choose a region for the server and its name. You will also be asked to enter API information for your chosen provider.
4. Wait for the setup to complete (this usually takes around five minutes) and look for the ~/streisand folder in your home directory. The instructions, files, and keys for the new server will be located there. You are all done!

You can also run Streisand on any number of new Debian 7 servers. Dedicated hardware? Great! Esoteric cloud provider? Awesome! To do this, simply edit the 'inventory' file and uncomment the final two lines. Replace the sample IP with the address (or addresses) of the servers you wish to configure. Then run the Streisand playbook directly:

    ansible-playbook streisand.yml

The servers should be accessible using SSH keys, and 'root' is used as the connecting user by default (though this is simple to change in the streisand.yml file, if necessary).
