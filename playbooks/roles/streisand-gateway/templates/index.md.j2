Welcome to the **{{ streisand_server_name }}** [Streisand](https://github.com/jlund/streisand) Gateway server. You are only moments away from an uncensored connection to the Internet.

Connection Instructions
-----------------------
---

There are multiple ways to bypass internet censorship. Streisand provides many choices and protocols. The list below is provided in descending order of 'usability'. Generally, L2TP/IPsec and OpenVPN is faster than the rest.

{# L2TP/IPsec is not installed on Amazon servers #}
{% if l2tp_ipsec_gateway_location %}
* [L2TP/IPsec](/l2tp-ipsec/)
{% endif %}
* [OpenVPN (direct)](/openvpn/)
* [OpenVPN (stunnel)](/openvpn/stunnel.html)
* [Shadowsocks](/shadowsocks/)
* [SSH](/ssh/)
* [Tor](/tor/)

Client Mirrors
--------------

In case the download links for the clients are blocked, you can download the client software directly from streisand. These versions could be slightly out of date, so they will automatically update themselves once installed.

* [OpenVPN](/mirror/#openvpn)
* [Shadowsocks](/mirror/#shadowsocks)
* [SSH](/mirror/#ssh)
* [stunnel](/mirror/#stunnel)
* [Tor Browser Bundle](/mirror/#tor)
