OpenConnect / Cisco AnyConnect
-----------
OpenConnect is an extremely high-performance and lightweight VPN server that also features full compatibility with the official Cisco AnyConnect clients. The [protocol](http://www.infradead.org/ocserv/technical.html) is built on top of standards like HTTP, TLS, and DTLS, and it's one of the most popular and widely used VPN technologies among large multi-national corporations. This means that in addition to its ease-of-use and speed, OpenConnect is also highly resistant to censorship and is almost never blocked.
