### Manual SSL Verification ###
***Note:** The manual certificate verification option is significantly less secure than installing the certificate using one of the methods above. Your browser will display a warning message, and you are more vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks because the fingerprints must be verified on every connection attempt. It should be used with great care, and only as a last resort.*

The certificate details should match the following information:

**Serial Number:** `{{ ssl_certificate_serial_number.stdout }}`

**Fingerprints:**

{% for fingerprint in ssl_certificate_fingerprints.results %}
`{{ fingerprint.stdout }}`

{% endfor %}

If everything checks out, you are ready to connect and you can skip to the [SSL](#ssl) section.
