1. Launch the Settings application
1. Scroll to the Personal section and tap 'Security'

1. Enter `{{ streisand_server_name }}` for the "Certificate name", and make sure 'VPN and apps' is selected for the "Credential use" value
1. Tap 'OK'
1. You are ready to connect. Skip to the [SSL Connection Details](#ssl) section.

Manual SSL Verification
-----------------------
***Note:** The manual certificate verification option is significantly less secure than installing the certificate using one of the methods above. Your browser will display a warning message, and you are more vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks because the fingerprints must be verified on every connection attempt. It should be used with great care, and only as a last resort.*

You can view the Gateway certificate details in your browser and ensure that the following information matches:

**Serial Number:** `{{ ssl_certificate_serial_number.stdout }}`

**Fingerprints:**

{% for fingerprint in ssl_certificate_fingerprints.results %}
`{{ fingerprint.stdout }}`

{% endfor %}

If everything checks out, you are ready to connect and you can skip to the [SSL](#ssl) section.
