Tor Bridge
==========

Linux, OS X, Windows
--------------------
1. Download the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-beta). The Obfsproxy obfs3 pluggable transport that it includes will let you use the Tor network even if your ISP is actively performing Deep Packet Inspection in an attempt to block all Tor traffic.

   If your ISP is blocking your ability to download the Tor Browser Bundle from the official website, you can try the [EFF mirror](https://s.eff.org/tor-mirror/projects/torbrowser.html.en) or the [torservers.net mirror](https://s.eff.org/tor-mirror/projects/torbrowser.html.en).
   
   If you cannot access any of the mirrors either, you can receive a copy via email by sending a blank message to 'gettor@torproject.org'.
2. Launch the Tor Browser Bundle
3. Click the 'Configure' button underneath the text that says "I need to configure bridge, firewall, or proxy settings."
4. Answer 'Yes' or 'No' to these questions, depending on your setup: "Does this computer need to use a proxy..." and "Does this computer's Internet connection go through a firewall..." In most cases the answer to both will be 'No.'
5. Answer 'Yes' to "Does your Internet Service Provider (ISP) block or otherwise censor connections to the Tor Network?"
6. Choose the 'Enter custom bridges' option, and paste the following information into the text box:

         obfs3 {{ tor_obfs3_connection_details }} {{ tor_fingerprint.stdout|lower }}
7. Click 'Connect'

You are ready to go! Tor has connected to the '{{ tor_bridge_nickname.stdout }}' bridge server, and your encrypted Tor traffic is completely obscured by obfsproxy so it doesn't look like Tor traffic at all!

Android
-------
1. Download [Orbot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) and launch it
2. Tap the Settings icon
3. Scroll to the Bridges section
4. Check the 'Use Bridges' checkbox
5. Tap 'Bridges' and enter the following:

         {{ tor_standard_connection_details }}
6. Go back, then long press on the power button to activate Orbot.
7. Tap the 'Log' button on the bottom of the screen. The fingerprint for the bridge should match the following (look for a line that begins with "NOTICE: Learned fingerprint"):

         {{ tor_fingerprint.stdout }}

Great! Orbot has connected to the '{{ tor_bridge_nickname.stdout }}' bridge server!

*Note: The version of Orbot in the Play Store only supports the obfs2 pluggable transport. The obfs2 pluggable transport is in the process of [being deprecated](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10314) and no longer works in China due to active probing attacks. The next version of Orbot, v14, will support the obfs3 and scramblesuit pluggable transports. It is currently scheduled for a [Beta in June and a Release Candidate in July](https://twitter.com/joshualund/status/466390416485810176). If you are brave, you can try the [Alpha release](https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-May/003493.html) and use '{{ tor_obfs3_connection_details }}' as an obfs3 bridge!*

You are now ready to configure Twitter and Firefox to route their traffic through Orbot.

### Configuring Twitter for Android to use Orbot ###
1. Open Twitter
2. Tap the three dots in the upper-right of the screen to open the menu
3. Choose 'Settings'
4. Tap 'General'
5. Tap 'Proxy'
6. Check the 'Enable HTTP Proxy' checkbox
7. Tap 'Proxy Host' and enter '127.0.0.1'
8. Tap 'Proxy Port' and enter '8118'

### Configuring Firefox for Android to use Orbot ###
1. Open Firefox
2. Type "about:config" into the address bar and tap the 'Go' button on your keyboard
3. Type "proxy" into the search box
4. Set the value of 'network.proxy.socks' to '127.0.0.1'
5. Set the value of 'network.proxy.socks_port' to '9050'
6. Set the value of 'network.proxy.socks\_remote\_dns' to 'true'
7. Set the value of 'network.proxy.type' to '1'

iOS
---
1. Download [Onion Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448?mt=8) and launch it
2. Tap the menu button on the bottom of the screen and choose 'Browser Settings'
3. Scroll to the bottom and tap 'Not Using Bridges'. If Onion Browser has not yet connected to Tor when you press the menu button, the 'Opening Bridge Configuration' popup will automatically appear.
4. Tap 'Edit' in the Bridges section
5. Tap the '+' button
6. Touch the 'Tap Here To Edit' field
7. Enter the following for your bridge information: '{{ tor_standard_connection_details }}'
8. Tap 'Done' (twice)
9. Tap 'Back'
10. Tap the 'Quit app' button when the 'Bridges' popup appears
11. Relaunch the application. If you successfully connect, the '{{ tor_bridge_nickname.stdout }}' bridge is working correctly!

*Note: Onion Browser does not currently support any pluggable transports and cannot be used in countries that are blocking Tor using Deep Packet Inspection or active probing attacks. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-OnionBrowser/issues/43) on the project's GitHub issue tracker requesting this functionality.*
