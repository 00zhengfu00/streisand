OpenVPN
=======
*If OpenVPN connections are being blocked in your country, please refer to the [OpenVPN (stunnel)](/openvpn/stunnel.html) instructions instead which will help you wrap your OpenVPN traffic in an encrypted tunnel so it looks like standard SSL traffic.*

### A note on client files ###
For security reasons, OpenVPN clients typically have their own unique certificate and private key. The server you will be connecting to has been configured to allow clients to share the same certificate and private key, but you may still wish to give your phone and laptop different keys, for example.

Windows
-------
1. Download and run the OpenVPN [Windows Installer](/mirror/#openvpn)
1. Click 'Next' and accept the license agreement by clicking 'I Agree'

{% for client in openvpn_clients %}
   * [{{ client }}](/openvpn/{{ client }}/{{ openvpn_direct_profile_filename }})
{% endfor %}
1. Open the 'config' directory that is located in the Destination Folder. For most users, this will either be in C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config or C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenVPN\config. You will see a single README file in this directory.
1. Drag and drop the downloaded '{{ openvpn_direct_profile_filename }}' file to this location alongside the README.

Linux
-----
1. Install OpenVPN

   `sudo apt-get install openvpn` OR `sudo yum install openvpn` OR `esoteric-package-manager hipster openvpn`

{% for client in openvpn_clients %}
   * [{{ client }}](/openvpn/{{ client }}/{{ openvpn_direct_profile_filename }})
{% endfor %}
1. Copy the downloaded '{{ openvpn_direct_profile_filename }}' file to the location of your choice. /etc/openvpn/ is a decent option.

Linux (Ubuntu)
--------------
It's preferable to configure Ubuntu using the OpenVPN plugin for NetworkManager. This gives you a nice little interface for connecting, and it properly handles the necessary DNS changes when you connect/disconnect. Unfortunately, the plugin does not support .ovpn profiles, so the list of steps is a little more involved.

1. First, download all of the .crt and .key files from one of these directories:
{% for client in openvpn_clients %}
   * [{{ client }}](/openvpn/{{ client }})
{% endfor %}
1. Install the OpenVPN plugin for NetworkManager

   `sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn`
1. Open your System Settings
1. Click the Network icon
1. Click the '+' button in the lower-left of the window
1. Select 'VPN' from the Interface drop-down and click 'Create'
1. Select 'OpenVPN' and click 'Create'
1. Enter '{{ streisand_server_name }}' for the 'Connection name'
1. Enter '{{ openvpn_server }}' for the 'Gateway'
1. Make sure 'Certificates (TLS)' is selected for the 'Type'
1. Select 'client.crt' from the client-files directory of your choice for the 'User Certificate'
1. Select 'ca.crt' from the same client-files directory for the 'CA Certificate'
1. Select 'client.key' from the same client-files directory for the 'Private Key'
1. Click the 'Advanced' button
1. Go to the General tab
   * Check 'Use custom gateway port' and enter '{{ openvpn_port }}' as its value
   * Check 'Use LZO data compression'
   * Check 'Use a TCP connection'
1. Go to the Security tab
   * Select '{{ openvpn_cipher }}' as the Cipher
   * Select '{{ openvpn_auth_digest }}' as the HMAC Authentication
1. Go to the TLS Authentication tab
   * Check 'Verify peer (server) certificate usage signature'
   * Check 'Use additional TLS authentication'
     * Select 'ta.key' from the client-files directory for the 'Key File'
     * Select '1' as the 'Key Direction'
   * Click 'OK'
1. Click 'Save...'
1. Select the VPN in the left-hand menu, and flip the switch to 'ON'. You can also enable/disable the VPN by clicking on the WiFi/Network icon in the menu bar, scrolling to 'VPN Connections', and clicking on its name.
1. Success! You can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by visiting the Tor Project's check page, [Are you using Tor?](https://check.torproject.org/) It should say 'Your IP address appears to be: {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}'.

1. Success! You can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by visiting the Tor Project's check page, [Are you using Tor?](https://check.torproject.org/) It should say 'Your IP address appears to be: {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}'.

Firefox for Android has a DNS resolution [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=947801) that affects VPN users who are running Android 4.4. The following workaround ensures that lookups can be performed successfully, even if you remain connected to the OpenVPN server for an extended period of time.

### Configuring Firefox for Android to use the Dante SOCKS server ###
1. Open Firefox
1. Type "about:config" into the address bar and tap the 'Go' button on your keyboard
1. Type "proxy" into the search box
1. Set the value of 'network.proxy.socks' to '10.8.0.1'
1. Set the value of 'network.proxy.socks_port' to '1080'
